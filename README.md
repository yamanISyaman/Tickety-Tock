# Welcome to Tickety Tock

Tickety Tock is an imaginary hand-watches store, and this project is a commercial website for this store.

**Live Preview:** [Tickety Tock](https://ticketytock.pythonanywhere.com)

## Technologies

This project was built using Django for the backend. For the frontend, I used the [StellOrre](http://preview.themeforest.net/item/stella-orre-architecture-and-interior-html-template/full_screen_preview/24520864) template and made numerous modifications, customizations, and additions for both the CSS and JavaScript. The main purpose of this project was to enhance my Django skills.

**NOTE:** The initial commit does not represent the actual first state of the code. To avoid mixing with a real-life company, I had to change the name and data of this project, start a new Git repo, and remove half of the first commits. Anyhow, the first state of the code is the frontend template files and a new auto-generated Django project.

## Installation

First, install the dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next apply migrations:

`python manage.py migrate`

Then run `python manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the instructions

lastly, run:

`python manage.py runserver`


## Final Note

Finally, I would like to state that this is not the end of this project. In the future, I might expand it and add more advanced functionalities.
