"INOZINC is recommended to be used directly to metal as a self-priming primer/"
"coat to provide a long term protection of steel structures against "

"Resistance to mud cracking even at 125 microns thickness.<br>• Easy to "

"• Method of Application :\tConventional spray, nylon or polyester bruch for "
"small area only. When applying INOZINC Primer it is important to keep the "
"product stirred and to maintain a flow to prevent zinc settling in the spray "
"lines. Also, it is vital to use spray equipment that has not been "
"contaminated with organic solvents<br>• Mixing Ratio :\t3Kg (Comp A) to 7Kg "
"(Comp B)<br>• Mixing :\tAdd Comp.B (powder) to Comp. A (liquid) and stir "
"well before application in order to ensure that a uniform consistency is "
"achieved. Never mix more material than can be used within potlife. Mixed "
"materials not used within potlife must be discarded.<br>• Pot life :\t8 "
"hours (higher temperatures will shorten polife sharply).<br>• Thinner / "
"Cleaner :\tDo not thin. Clean applying tools by hot water.<br>• Application "
"Temperature :\t5-40 ?C at a RH not more than 85%% .<br>• Curing :\tThe "
"reaction between the two-component (A & B) can not be guaranteed unless a "
"temperature of at least 5°C is maintained for the mixture and the substrate "
"until complete curing. Temperature of substrate should be at least 3°C above "
"dew point to avoid moisture condensation during application. Relative "
"humidity during application and initial drying should not exceed 85%%.<br>• "
"Note :\t• Coated surfaces by INOZINC should not be exposed to water, "
"chemical fumes, or mechanical stresses before it is fully cured."
